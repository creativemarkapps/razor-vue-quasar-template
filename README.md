**Description**

This template combines the powerful feature-set of Vue3 and Microsofts' .Net Framework 6.0... leveraging the power of server side Razor pages and the reactive user experience of Vue.

**Design Considerations**

This template is designed with a server side SEO web approach instead of a SPA. The razor pages are highly performant loading only minimal information, after which all other data and user interactions are managed using Vue3 via the composition API with no Vue build process.

The architecture is simple, yet powerful, easy to use and extend according to your specific needs. A key feature of this design is flexibility and highly performant razor pages.

Razor pages are secured using server side authentication, upon which they are rendered with minimal information so that page loading times are extremely fast. Once the page is loaded, all other data interactions are controlled and managed using Vue.

An embedded JSON datastore is used to manage all server side state. The design of the data access layer enables you to easily swap the backend datastore out for and another type of datastore such as SQL Server, Postgress SQL etc.

This template uses the Quasar Framework, is a highly customizable, performant best in class UI framework library.

In modern web applications, security is of paramount concern. This template was built with that in mind. To that end, it utilizes the trusted security features of Microsofts' .Net Framework to secure the application. This is achieved using a variety of techniques, one of which is the encrypted authentication cookie that is validated upon every page request. Subsequent server side requests from the client side must also meet certain validation and authentication protocols to secure against other forms of attacks from the UI.
